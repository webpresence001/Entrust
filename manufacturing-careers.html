        <p class="p3">Projects are larger than a single person could possibly handle. The result of this is a culture of collaboration and teamwork, which puts talented people together and allows them to achieve a higher level of performance than they would as individuals. Collaboration extends beyond direct employees - suppliers, customers, and outside services are part of the team that allows the success and high standards demanded by our industry.</p></figure>
